# PSO2 GSHADE PRESETS

A simple collection of presets that I modified mildly from [XIV Gshade shader package](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade-Presets) to work well for PSO2NA and PSO2JP.

Note that it was made purely for SS purposes. A modification on those presets would be needed on your end if you were to use this for actual gameplay instead.

## Features 

• No further complex modification needed. Just apply the preset and you're good to go!

• Comes with several presets :_
