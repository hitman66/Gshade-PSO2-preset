A simple collection of presets that I modified mildly from [XIV Gshade shader package](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade-Presets) to work well for PSO2NA and PSO2JP.

Note that most of those are made purely for SS purposes only. I created `skybane [gameplay].ini` which should be suitable for those who aren't into DOF bullshit altogether.

## Features 

• No further complex modification needed. Just apply the preset and you're good to go!

• Comes with several presets :_
